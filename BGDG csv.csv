Bhagavad-gétä   is   the   widely   read   theistic   science   summarized   in   theGétä-mähätmya (Glorification  of  the  Gétä).  There  it  says  that  one  should  readBhagavad-gétä very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee ofÇré    Kåñëa    and    try    to    understand    it    without    personally    motivatedinterpretations.   The   example   of   clear   understanding   is   there   in   theBhagavad-gétä  itself,  in  the  way  the  teaching  is  understood  by  Arjuna,  whoheard  the  Gétä  directly  from  the  Lord.  If  someone  is  fortunate  enough  tounderstand Bhagavad-gétä   in   that   line   of   disciplic   succession,   withoutmotivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and allscriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-gétä all that is containedin  other  scriptures,  but  the  reader  will  also  find  things  which  are  not  to  befound  elsewhere.  That  is  the  specific  standard  of  the  Gétä.  It  is  the  perfecttheistic  science  because  it  is  directly  spoken  by  the  Supreme  Personality  ofGodhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa.The  topics  discussed  by  Dhåtaräñöra  and  Saïjaya,  as  described  in  theMahäbhärata,   form   the   basic   principle   for   this   great   philosophy.   It   isunderstood  that  this  philosophy  evolved  on  the  Battlefield  of  Kurukñetra,which  is  a  sacred  place  of  pilgrimage  from  the  immemorial  time  of  the  Vedicage. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planetfor the guidance of mankind.The  word  dharma-kñetra  (a  place  where  religious  rituals  are  performed)  issignificant because, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, the Supreme Personalityof  Godhead  was  present  on  the  side  of  Arjuna.  Dhåtaräñöra,  the  father  of  theKurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory. Inhis doubt, he inquired from his secretary Saïjaya, “What did they do?” He wasconfident  that  both  his  sons  and  the  sons  of  his  younger  brother  Päëòu  wereassembled in that Field of Kurukñetra for a determined engagement of the war.Still,  his  inquiry  is  significant.  He  did  not  want  a  compromise  between  thecousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on thebattlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kurukñetra, whichis  mentioned  elsewhere  in  the  Vedas  as  a  place  of  worship—even  for  thedenizens  of  heaven—Dhåtaräñöra  became  very  fearful  about  the  influence  ofthe holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would
